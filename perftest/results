Just for perftest:
with 10000 runs, 1000000 clauses of size 5: about 10 reads per nanosecond, so about 2 clauses looked per nanosecond
adding the reporter made it drop by half. (but that's because there are lots of clauses to report)
Adding or not the actual checks inside the gpu rather than reading all the clauses didn't lead to a big loss (about 10%)

Have a variable number of clauses doesn't change much versus a fixed one
